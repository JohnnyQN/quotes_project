Project Ideas for Capstone
1. Recipe Re-Creator: Restaurant Dishes at Home
API: Spoonacular API
Idea: This application will assist users in recreating their favorite dishes from restaurants at home. Users can input a dish name or ingredients to receive suggestions for similar recipes with step-by-step instructions. The app will also provide tips on how to modify recipes to more closely match the original dish. A community feature will enable users to share their own recreations and culinary tips.
Problem Solved: Helps users enjoy their favorite restaurant dishes at home by offering tailored recipes and cooking tips.
2. Local Restaurant Finder and Review Aggregator
API: Yelp Fusion API
Idea: This app will help users discover nearby restaurants based on their location and preferences. It will aggregate reviews and provide personalized recommendations to improve dining choices. Additional features may include reservation capabilities and curated dining guides.
Problem Solved: Simplifies the process of finding and choosing restaurants by aggregating reviews and offering personalized recommendations.
3. Quotes App
API: Quotable
Idea: This app will provide users with a daily dose of inspirational or humorous quotes. Features will include sharing options, a personalized quote feed based on user preferences, and a submission option for user-contributed quotes. The app will also allow users to generate quotes based on their mood or situation.
Problem Solved: Offers users daily inspiration and entertainment, with personalized and mood-based quote recommendations.
Quotes App with Community Voting (Preferred Idea)
API: Quotable
Idea: This enhanced version of the Quotes App will include a community voting system. Users can vote for their favorite quotes each day, and the most popular quote will be featured as the “Quote of the Day.” Users will also have the ability to submit their own quotes and vote on others.
Features:
Daily Quotes: Display a new quote each day.
Quote Submission: Users can submit their favorite quotes for future voting.
Voting System: Users can vote on quotes using upvotes/downvotes or a star rating system.
Quote of the Day: The most-voted quote from the previous day will be featured.
Share Quotes: Users can share quotes on social media or through direct links.
Personalized Quotes: Optionally, users can receive quotes based on mood or preferences.
Problem Solved: Provides daily inspiration and entertainment while engaging users through a voting system, making the app more dynamic and interactive.
Technical Considerations: Includes database management for quotes, votes, and user profiles, backend development for voting and daily updates, and user-friendly interface design.
Why This Project?
I am particularly interested in the Quotes App with Community Voting because it combines a straightforward API integration with engaging features that enhance user interaction. This project will showcase my ability to integrate external APIs, manage user data, and implement interactive features, all while providing a valuable and enjoyable service to users.

The most-voted quote from the previous day will be featured on the homepage.
Personalized Feed:
Users can personalize their feed by selecting preferred categories (e.g., inspirational, funny, motivational) or receive random quotes.

A leaderboard displaying top-rated quotes or top contributors will create community engagement and competition.
Favorites (Stretch Goal):
Users can save quotes in a personal collection viewable from their profile.

Sign-up/Login:
Users create an account using a unique username, email, and password. Existing users log in to access their personalized quote feed and voting options.
Home Page (Daily Quote):
A fresh quote is displayed each day with options to upvote/downvote, view more details, or share the quote. The "Quote of the Day" is highlighted at the top.
Quote Submission:

Search:
A search bar will allow users to find specific quotes by entering keywords, authors, or categories. The results will be displayed dynamically as users type.

Data:
Data Source:
API: Quotable API for retrieving quotes.
User Input: User-submitted quotes stored in the database.
Data Storage:
PostgreSQL will store user data, votes, submitted quotes, search history, and favorites.
Quotes from the Quotable API will be cached for performance optimization.

Database Schema:

API & Data Security:
API Handling:
Quotable API will provide daily quotes. Proper error handling will manage API failures or unavailable data.

Passwords will be securely hashed with bcrypt, and HTTPS will be implemented to secure data transfers.
All sensitive user information (like passwords and email addresses) will be encrypted and handled securely.

Stretch Goals:
Improved Quote Recommendation Algorithm:
Implement a more advanced algorithm that recommends quotes based on user preferences and interactions.
Community Features:
Add a forum or comment section for users to discuss and suggest quotes.

Conclusion:
This project blends API integration, user interaction, and CRUD functionality with features like voting, submitting, and searching for quotes. With a focus on community engagement, the app will provide a fun and interactive experience for users while showcasing a wide range of web development skills.
