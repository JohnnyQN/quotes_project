Capstone Project 2: Initial Project Ideas
1. Job Application Tracker
Problem:
Job seekers often struggle to keep track of applications, follow-ups, interviews, and offer statuses. Many rely on spreadsheets or handwritten notes, which lack automation and real-time reminders. This inefficiency leads to missed opportunities and difficulty in managing multiple applications.
Solution:
A Job Application Tracker that helps users organize and manage their job search efficiently. This application will provide a centralized dashboard to track applications, schedule interviews, set reminders, and analyze job search trends.
Key Features:
User Authentication – Secure login and registration.
Job Application Management – Track company, position, date applied, interview stage, and outcome.
Application Status Pipeline – Visualize the progress of applications from ‘Applied’ to ‘Interview’ to ‘Offer’ or ‘Rejected.’
Google Calendar API Integration – Schedule interviews with automated reminders (Free tier available).
Resume Matching Feature (Optional Future Expansion) – Can integrate open-source NLP models instead of paid APIs.
Notes Section – Users can add notes and key takeaways from each interview.
Job Board Data Entry – Since LinkedIn API access is restricted, job details will be entered manually or sourced from open job board APIs if available.
Potential Data Sources:
User-generated data (Job applications, interview progress, notes).
Google Calendar API (For scheduling and reminders, using free quota).
Manually entered job details (Instead of relying on LinkedIn API restrictions).
Open-source NLP models (If resume matching is implemented in the future).
Why This Project?
Real-world impact: It directly benefits job seekers, including myself, in managing the application process.
Strong portfolio piece: Demonstrates full-stack development with authentication, API integration, and database management.
Scalability: Can be expanded to include analytics on job search trends.
No mandatory paid APIs: The entire system can be built using free-tier APIs or manual data entry.

2. Car Build & Mod Tracker
Problem:
Car enthusiasts, tuners, and builders often track their modifications and builds using spreadsheets, forum posts, or handwritten notes. There is no dedicated platform to organize, document, and showcase car modifications efficiently.
Solution:
A Car Build & Mod Tracker that allows users to log modifications, track part installations, calculate expenses, and share progress with others. This tool would provide an intuitive way to organize vehicle build details while enabling enthusiasts to document their journey visually.
Key Features:
User Authentication – Secure login and profile creation.
Manage Multiple Car Builds – Each user can track multiple vehicle projects.
Modification Logging – Add parts, labor, installation date, and cost breakdowns.
Photo Uploads & Before/After Comparisons – Document progress with images.
Budget & Expense Tracking – Keep track of build costs.
Car Query API Integration – Free-tier API providing basic car specifications.
Parts Data Entry by Users – Since most aftermarket parts APIs are paid, users will enter part details manually or via community-sourced data.
Community Feature (Optional) – Share builds with other users.
Potential Data Sources:
User-generated data (Car modifications, costs, build details, and images).
Car Query API (Free-tier access to car specifications and model details).
Manually entered part details (Instead of using paid aftermarket parts APIs).
Why This Project?
Aligns with personal passion: As someone deeply involved in car building, this is a useful and meaningful project.
Unique portfolio piece: Demonstrates API integration, CRUD operations, and media uploads.
Scalable & Community-Driven: Could evolve into a social platform for car enthusiasts.
No mandatory paid APIs: The project is fully achievable without requiring paid services.

3. NBA Stats Analysis App
Problem:
NBA fans, analysts, and fantasy basketball players often rely on multiple sources to track player and team performance. Finding advanced statistics, historical comparisons, and predictive analysis in one place can be difficult.
Solution:
An NBA Stats Analysis App that aggregates player and team statistics, visualizes trends, and provides insightful analytics for fans and fantasy basketball users.
Key Features:
Player Performance Tracker – View real-time and historical stats for individual players.
Team Comparisons – Compare two teams based on multiple performance metrics.
Advanced Analytics – Analyze efficiency ratings, PER, offensive & defensive stats.
Predictive Insights – Use machine learning models (Optional Future Expansion) to forecast player performance.
Custom Visualization Dashboard – Interactive graphs and charts for better insights.
Fantasy Basketball Integration (Optional) – Allow users to compare potential fantasy trades.
Potential Data Sources:
NBA API (Free-tier access to basic player and team stats).
Basketball Reference Scraping (If permitted under terms of service).
User-generated custom comparisons and insights.
Why This Project?
Sports and data-driven focus: Appeals to NBA fans, analysts, and fantasy basketball players.
Strong technical showcase: Features API integration, data visualization, and optional machine learning predictions.
Scalability: Can expand to cover historical data trends and predictive analytics.
No mandatory paid APIs: Uses publicly available NBA stats and free APIs.

Next Steps:
These three projects are my primary choices for the capstone. These are listed in order of preference. The Job Application Tracker and Car Build & Mod Tracker are my top choices, while the NBA Stats Analysis App is the previous third option as a data-driven, sports analytics project.
By relying on free-tier APIs and manual data entry where necessary, these projects remain cost-effective while retaining full functionality. I look forward to discussing these ideas and receiving feedback from my mentor.
Thank you for your consideration!
